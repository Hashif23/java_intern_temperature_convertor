# Java Temperature Converter

This Java program is a simple temperature converter that allows users to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin units. It takes a temperature value from the user and converts it to another unit based on their input.


## How it Works

- The program prompts the user to input a temperature value.
- It validates the input to ensure it's a valid float number.
- Then, it asks the user to input the unit of the temperature they've entered and the unit they want to convert to.
- The conversion logic is implemented in the `convertTemperature` method.
- If the units are invalid, it prints an error message and exits the program.
